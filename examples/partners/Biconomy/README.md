# Biconomy

## Biconomy is your one stop solution for all on-chain UX simplification and abstraction.

## What is Biconomy?
Biconomy is a web3 infrastructure solution with a product suite focused on simplifying web3 UX for web2 users.

We've been leading the relayer infra space for the last 4 years and have processed 28 Million Gasless transactions and onboarded 3.5 Million users for our 200+ partners.
Now, our prime product offering is our new Account Abstraction SDK and we're proud market leaders in the Account Abstraction space with above 80% of Smart Accounts deployed and above 70% of all ERC 4337 transactions processed. (Data accounted till May 2023)


## What our SDK can enable for you:
1. Users don't have a web3 wallet in place? Using Biconomy, you can enable them to sign in using their Gmail/Facebook and we'll create new non-custodial wallets for your users. Best part - Your users won't have to worry about storing private keys, signing transactions, seed phrase, etc. due to MPC.
2. Give users a seamless "Gasless" experience by choosing to sponsor their Transaction fee. You can choose which transactions you want to sponsor and which users you want to sponsor transactions for as well!
3. Transaction Batching: Batch multiple transactions like "approve and swap" or "approve, swap and transfer", into a single atomic transaction. This converts multi-click experiences into single click ones and saves on Gas fee.
4. Fiat On-Ramps: Enable your users to use their credit or debit cards to onboard funds into their newly created "Smart Wallets".
5. Cross Chain: Enable your users to transfer funds between different chains using our state of the art liquidity bridge Hyphen. We take pride in Hyphen being one of the fastest and cheapest bridges in the market as of now.
