# Deploy a Contract

Deploy allows you to deploy a smart contract to any EVM compatible network without configuring RPC URLs, exposing your private keys, writing scripts, and other additional setup such as verifying your contract.

1. To deploy your smart contract using deploy, navigate to the root directory of your project and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   npx thirdweb deploy
   ```

   Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

   - Compiling all the contracts in the current directory.
   - Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy.
   - Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.

2. When it is completed, it will open a dashboard interface to finish filling out the parameters.
   - `_name`: contract name
   - `_symbol`: symbol or "ticker"
   - `_royaltyRecipient`: wallet address to receive royalties from secondary sales
   - `_royaltyBps`: basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty recipient for each secondary sale, e.g. 500 = 5%
3. Select the desired EVM network as the network
4. Manage additional settings on your contract’s dashboard as needed such as uploading NFTs, configuring permissions, and more.
