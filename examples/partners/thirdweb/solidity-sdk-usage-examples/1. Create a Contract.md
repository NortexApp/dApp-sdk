# Create a Contract

To create a new smart contract using thirdweb CLI, follow these steps:

1. In your CLI run the following command:

   ```
   npx thirdweb create contract
   ```

2. Input your preferences for the command line prompts:
   1. Give your project a name
   2. Choose your preferred framework: Hardhat or Foundry
   3. Name your smart contract
   4. Choose the type of base contract: Empty, [ERC20](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc20base), [ERC721](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc721base), or [ERC1155](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/base-contracts/erc1155base)
   5. Add any desired [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solidity/extensions)
3. Once created, navigate to your project’s directory and open in your preferred code editor.
4. If you open the `contracts` folder, you will find your smart contract; this is your smart contract written in Solidity.

   The following is code for an ERC721Base contract without specified extensions. It implements all of the logic inside the [ERC721Base.sol](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol) contract; which implements the [ERC721A](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/eip/ERC721A.sol) standard.

   ```bash
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

   contract Contract is ERC721Base {
       constructor(
           string memory _name,
           string memory _symbol,
           address _royaltyRecipient,
           uint128 _royaltyBps
       ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
   }
   ```

   This contract inherits the functionality of ERC721Base through the following steps:

   - Importing the ERC721Base contract
   - Inheriting the contract by declaring that our contract is an ERC721Base contract
   - Implementing any required methods, such as the constructor.

5. After modifying your contract with your desired custom logic, you may deploy it to **any EVM** chain using [Deploy](https://portal.thirdweb.com/deploy).

Alternatively, you can deploy a prebuilt contract for NFTs, tokens, or marketplace directly from the thirdweb Explore page:

1. Go to the thirdweb Explore page: https://thirdweb.com/explore

2. Choose the type of contract you want to deploy from the available options: NFTs, tokens, marketplace, and more.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure and deploy your contract.

> For more information on different contracts available on Explore, check out [thirdweb’s documentation.](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts)
