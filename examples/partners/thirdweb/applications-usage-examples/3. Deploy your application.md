# Deploy your application

To host your static web application on decentralized storage, run:

```jsx
npx thirdweb deploy --app
```

By running this command, your application is built for production and stored using Storage. The built application is uploaded to IPFS, a decentralized storage network, and a unique URL is generated for your application.

This URL serves as a permanent hosting location for your application on the web.
