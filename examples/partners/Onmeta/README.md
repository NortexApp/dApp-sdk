# Onmeta

[Onmeta](https://www.onmeta.in/) provides the underlying infrastructure that allows Crypto wallets, Web3 Gaming platforms, Defi Platforms,  NFT marketplaces & other Dapps to allow their end users to exchange fiat currency for crypto tokens and crypto tokens for fiat currency.

## Product Overview

Onmeta provides quickest on and off ramp solutions (Widget/API integration) to web3 dapps to help them improve their user experience and accelerate their adoption by mainstream users. Onmeta aims to become a fully interoperable solution which supports all major fiat currencies as well as all tokens across all major blockchains. It supports 6000+ tokens across Polygon, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom, ZkEvm, Solana, Optimism and BNB Smart Chain blockchains with work underway for supporting 25+ blockchains by the end of this year. 

We support the following integration methods for our services i.e. both On and Off Ramp. 
1. Widget Integration
2. API Integration

### Widget
Onmeta's cryptocurrency widget is a versatile solution that enables businesses to quickly and easily integrate cryptocurrency buying and selling into their platforms. We support multiple currencies - INR (Indian National Rupee) and PHP (Philippine peso)
and hence provide multiple payment channels. <br />
	UPI, IMPS, NEFT - INR <br />
	GCASH, PAYMAYA, GRABPAY - PHP 

## Example

Given below are the integration steps to embed the widget in your website : 

1. Add the Onmeta sdk script tag to your HTML file:

```HTML
<script src="https://stg.platform.onmeta.in/onmeta-sdk.js"></script>
```

2. Then, initialize the widget in your application:

```HTML
<script >
    let createWidget = new onMetaWidget({
        // (It should be an id of an element not a class) which is set in step 2 above
        elementId: "widget", // Mandatory
        apiKey: "{api_key}", // Mandatory
        walletAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
        fiatAmount: 100, // Optional (If passed then minimum amount is 100 inr)
        userEmail: "test@test.com", // Optional (if passed user don't have to register in meta platform)
        chainId: "80001", // Optional (it should be passed along with the tokenAddress to show a particular token to the user)
        tokenAddress: "0xEcc24eab0fb83Ef0c536b35C44C578F750FDBB6E", // Optional
        metaData: {"userID" : "ABCDXXX", "userName" : "user"} // Optional
        successRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
        failureRedirectUrl : "https://www.sample.net", // Optional
    });
createWidget.init(); // it will initialize the widget inside the particular div element
createWidget.on(eventType, callbackFn); // this method will listen to the events of the widget
</script>
```
