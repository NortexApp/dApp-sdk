## What is Decent?

Decent is an NFT creation and infrastructure tool that enables creators and developers to launch, edit, and analyze their NFT-based applications.  We have a multi-chain protocol, SDK, APIs, and a no-code application to make building and management as easy as possible.

## Product Overview
### The Box

Our flagship product, [The Box](http://decent.xyz/box), enables 1-click checkout for any NFT, with any token across chains and sale types.  The Box makes transacting with NFTs on any chain as easy as Ethereum by completely abstracting the need for users to bridge and swap tokens.  It also sources secondary market listings for collections, so the same button works consistently across primary and secondary sales.

### Protocol
Our NFT contracts and utility wrappers.  You can find the protocol repository [here](https://github.com/decentxyz/DecentSDK-protocol), and relevant documentation + additional demo recipes [here](https://docs.decent.xyz/docs).

### API's
Easily fetch data for any contract deployed through the Decent Protocol or publish an allowlist from your application to a Decent contract. You can test the API through our interactive modal in our [documentation](https://docs.decent.xyz/reference/get_contracts-chainid-address).

### Template Repositories
Get up and running as quickly as possible with our starter repo's:
- [Minting Page](https://github.com/decentxyz/Minting-Page): custom minting page for a single NFT
- [Portfolio Page](/examples//Decent/Minting-Gallery-App/): custom minting page for a curated set of NFTs
- [Start Decent](https://github.com/decentxyz/Start-Decent): example implementation of the [deploy-editions](/examples/Decent/sdk-usage-examples/deploy-editions.tsx) function

### Creator Studio
No code interface to launch, manage, and analyze your contracts.  Integrate with third-party applications to get the most out of your NFTs or browse & collect others' projects.
