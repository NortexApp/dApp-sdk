# Push Protocol 
## Enable Web3 notifications, chat, group chat, token gating or social communications (video call, streaming, etc) in your dApp

## What is Push Protocol?
Push Protocol, previously known as EPNS, is a Web3 communication protocol that enables any dApps, smart contracts, backends, or protocols to communicate both on-chain and off-chain via user wallet addresses in an open, gasless, multichain, and platform-agnostic fashion.

## What We Do
Being an open communication middleware, Push is building a suite of products to enable notifications, chats, streaming, and more. We currently have two major products, Push Notifications and Push Chat.
