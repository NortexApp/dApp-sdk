## SDK

MoonPay's SDK simplifies the process of integrating MoonPay's widget into a partner's platform. The SDK allows partners to customize the widget's appearance and functionality, while also providing a communication channel for streamlined integration. One of the key benefits of the SDK is the ability to receive real-time notifications about important flow lifecycle events. This allows partners to provide an integrated sell flow where the MoonPay widget instructs the partner's wallet app to perform the necessary sell deposit.

  variant: 'overlay',
  params: {
    apiKey: 'pk_test_key'
  },
  handlers: {
    async onInitiateDeposit(properties) {
      // Your own crypto deposit code
      const { cryptoCurrency, cryptoCurrencyAmount } = properties;
      const depositId = await deposit(cryptoCurrency.code, cryptoCurrencyAmount);
      return { depositId };
    }
