# dApp SDK

Welcome to the dApp SDK, your one-stop solution for creating decentralized applications
(dApps) with ease. The SDK provides a set of powerful, modular components that cover
essential aspects of dApp development, such as payments, messaging, identity, governance,
ads, and recommendations. Inspired by the Apple and Google development kits used for mobile
app development, our dApp SDK aims to streamline the process of building, testing, and
deploying dApps on various blockchain platforms.

This SDK can be used to build dApps and publish / distribute them on the dApp Stores
powered by dApp Store Kit.

## Features

The dApp SDK offers the following key components:

1. **Identity:** A comprehensive identity management module that provides user
   authentication, authorization, and user profile management in a decentralized manner.

2. **Notifications:** A secure, encrypted communication system module notifications between protocol, smart contracts or backend and wallet addresses. Supports on-chain (smart contract) or off-chain (server based) notifications with complete logic design freedom to developers.

3. **Messaging:** An encrypted messaging system enabling peer-to-peer communication between
   users, as well as group chats and broadcasting functionality and advanced functionality like token gating, nft gating, message gating, etc.

4. **Social Communication:** A peer-to-peer communication module that enables wallet to do video calls, audio calls, twitter spaces, youtube live functionality to enable pure web3 native communication.

5. **Payments:** A robust and secure payment module for handling cryptocurrency
   transactions, including support for multiple tokens and seamless integration with popular
   wallet providers. Supports Recurring, Seat Based or One Time payment. Integrated with the
   dApp Store Fee module.

6. **Governance:** A flexible governance framework for implementing voting, proposals, and
   decision-making processes within your dApp, fostering community involvement and
   decentralized control.

7. **Zero Knowledge (ZK) Ads:** An advertising module for promoting products, services, and content within your
   dApp, featuring a transparent, user-controlled ad system that respects user privacy.

8. **Recommendations:** A machine learning-powered recommendation engine that generates
   personalized content suggestions for users based on their preferences and behavior within
   the dApp.

9. **Compute:** The Compute module offers a powerful, decentralized computing platform that
   allows developers to run complex tasks such as machine learning, data analytics, and other
   resource-intensive processes. Leveraging a network of decentralized providers, the Compute
   module provides a cost-effective and resilient solution for your dApp's computing needs.

10. **Storage:** The Storage module offers a decentralized storage solution for your dApp,
    allowing you to store, retrieve, and manage large and small files across a distributed
    network of storage providers. This module also includes CDN support for efficient content
    delivery to users worldwide.

11. **Device:** The device module offers access to device details.

12. **Solidity:** The Solidity module offers the tools needed to build custom smart contracts efficiently by offering a set of prebuilt base contracts and a set of reusable components, or extensions, that can be integrated into your own smart contracts.

13. **Applications:** The Applications module offers SDKs for a range of programming languages, such as React, React Native, TypeScript, Python, Go, and Unity.

14. **Gamification:** Multi-platform solutions to support every type of gaming enthusiast, Ready is spearheading the collective web3 gaming era.
